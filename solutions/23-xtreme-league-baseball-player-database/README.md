## Instructions
> The hosts *active* and *penalty* contain files that correspond to extreme baseball players (files 200-299), along with a directory file that contains a list of those files' IDs (file 199). Each player file contains their name and the following statistics in this order: BA, ZA, APB, WRT, OI, OD, PC, and PS.
> 
> Create a file in your host with the name of the player with the highest score using EMBER-2's algorithm:
> 
> SCORE = (BA + ZA + APB) / 3 + ( WRT \* OI ) / OD + (PC - PS) \* 20
> 
> Players in the *penalty* host should be ignored, as they are currently banned from the game.
