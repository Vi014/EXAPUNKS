# 27: TEC EXA-Blaster Modem (Dataphone Network)

<div align="center"><img src="EXAPUNKS - TEC EXA-Blasterâ„¢ Modem (2877, 57, 18, 2023-10-08-00-06-04).gif" /></div>

## Instructions
> Using your modem, connect to each dataphone so that EMBER-2 will have a list of valid phone numbers.
> 
> Each dataphone contains a list of the owner's contacts (file 200). The phone number of one of these dataphones is in your host (file 300), while the rest are in the contact list of another dataphone.
> 
> Note that each dataphone (aside from the first) will appear in exactly one other dataphone's contact list, in such a way that you can find them all without getting stuck in a loop.
> 
> For more information see "Hacker Skills: Modem Control at the Direct Level" in the second issue of the zine.
